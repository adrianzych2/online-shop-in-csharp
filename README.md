An online eCommerce web-application, where users can browse products, add them into a shopping cart, then check out and make payments. When creating the project, together with two colleagues, members of our team, we tried to maintain the appropriate project architecture (view-model-control). We used Entity Framework to create the database, we used the Identity library to create users. We also used the Dependency Injection pattern. The project was also an opportunity for us to practice using interfaces and class inheritance.
